# code-refactor-homework

In this excercise, I have gone through the code and added multiple different items to make the accesibilty better. Images have alt tags attached with relevent descriptions, a meta description has been added that accurately states what is on the page. Additionally, a title has been added to replace 'website'.

The has links in the nav bar have been corrected as well and all go to their appropriate link in the description.
